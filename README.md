# Dummy Contribution Lab

This repository is used to simulate real-world open-source contribution workflows.

The goal is not to write complex code.
The goal is to demonstrate professional Git hygiene, communication clarity, and respect for maintainer time.

## Who This Is For
- Students preparing for GSoC or serious open-source work
- Developers who want to fix bad Git and PR habits early

## What This Repo Is NOT
- A playground: This isn't a platform for random, low-effort or experimental changes. Every change must strictly follow contribution rules and have a clear purpose.
- A tutorial: This repo is not designed to teach Git or Github from scratch. Contributors are expected to know how to create issues, branches and pull requests.
- A place for unreviewed commits: Contributers are expected to work on a separate branch, open a pull request and get a review before anything is merged.

## Contribution Rules (Read Carefully)
- All contributions must start with an Issue
- All Pull Requests must follow the provided template
- Commit history must be clean and meaningful
- Pull Requests that violate guidelines may be closed without comment

If this feels strict, that is intentional.
